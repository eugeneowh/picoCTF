Seems like it is a quiz to see how fast you can figure out what format was given and covert it to the requested ones. Hence, get cyberchef `www.cyberchef.org` ready and all will be good!
Use magic, as it would automatically detect the most likely format conversion. Everytime you restart the quiz, it would give a different question, so be prepared!

After answer the quiz, it would reveal the flag.
