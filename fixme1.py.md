Downloading the file gives a python code.

We can try to look through the code and see what is wrong, but let's just run it and see if it gives an error. `python3 fixme1.py`

Seems like a simple indentation error. lets fix it. Python is an indentation sensitive language, where consistent indentation between different lines are important. Default is a tab of 4 spaces, but as long as it is consistent it would run properly.
So, for this, lets remove the spaces before the `print` statement to be flushed with an indent of 0.

Yep. after removing the indent, it ran and gave the code.`python3 fixme1.py`
